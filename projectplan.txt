Plan for experiment design: 

1) Identify suitable corpus
-Must include documents that can be pre-categorized + long enough for BOW repre>
-Must be able to be edited into BOW (probably just needs to be .txt)

2) Create Bag-of-Words (BOW) representations
-Use Perl script to remove function words + context dependent meanings
-Shuffle using Fisher-Yates shuffling within documents
-print shuffled text into 3 columns
-1 BOW representation  per document

3) Experimental conditions;
 
i) Control
-remove title/subject
-reproduce original layout
-present stimulus
-remove stimulus after time limit
-record subject response in file

ii) Test 
-remove title/subject 
-present BOW representation
-present stimulus
-remove stimulus after time limit
-record subject response in file

4) Run experiment

5) Results
-Scatter plot comparing participant accuracy between conditions
-present averages in a table
-if I decide to run multiple time limits then present line graph comparing cond>

Excluded from Wolf (2006) expriment:

a) I will most likely only use two time limits (2 sec and unlimited) 

b) I am omitting post-response confidence ratings
